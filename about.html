        <h2 style="color: brown;"> Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Sofia';">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through
            Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually
            there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest
            and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many
            events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them
            masquerade balls).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p style="color: brown;font-family: 'Sofia';">The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
            krewes; most follow
            the same parade
            schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
            Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
            large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
            as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
            traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
            doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the
            same parade schedule and route each year.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Sofia';">While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street,
            major
            parades originate in
            the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
            upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus -
            also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras
            day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

        <h1 style="color:coral;">LaToya Cantrell</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Sofia';">LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician
            serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold
            the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from
            2012–2018.</p>
        <h2 style="color:coral;"> Early life and education</h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Sofia';color: darkred;"> Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to
            New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She
            attended an executive training program at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
        <h2 style="color:coral;">Broadmoor neighborhood work</h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Sofia';">
            Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined
            the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.
            After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor
            neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the
            Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a
            recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into
            greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents and local
            religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning
            Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.
            <br>
            Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
            residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H.
            Wilson school.She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a
            community development corporation that provided case management and other social services for returning
            residents.She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library,
            which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment.She created a partnership between the
            Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood
            association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.She also formed a partnership between the
            Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
            Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.</p>
