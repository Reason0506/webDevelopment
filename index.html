            Gras Indian?</h1><br>
        <p><em>&quot;Mardi Gras Indians are secretive because only certain people participated in masking--people
                with
                questionable character. In the old day, the Indians were violent. Indians would meet on Mardi Gras;
                it was a
                day to settle scores.&quot;</em> - <strong>Larry Bannock, Past President, New Orleans Mardi Gras
                Indian
                Council</strong></p>


        <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of that secrecy as any other
            carnival
            organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in advance, although they do tend
            to gather
            in the same areas every year.</p>

        <p>The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities of New
            Orleans&#39;s inner
            city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade is perhaps the least
            recognized Mardi
            Gras tradition.</p>

        <p><em>&quot;Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don&#39;t see. The ceremonial procession is
                loose, the
                parade is not scheduled for a particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief.&quot;</em> -
            <strong>Larry Bannock</strong></p>


        <p>Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a &quot;krewe.&quot; A krewe often names their parade after a
            particular
            Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras Krewe is a parody of
            royalty: King,
            Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or some variation of that theme. Many of the more established krewes
            allow
            membership by invitation only.</p>

        <p>Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New Orleans parade. Historically,
            slavery and
            racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually
            developed
            their own style of celebrating Mardi Gras. Their krewes are named for imaginary Indian tribes according
            to the
            streets of their ward or gang.</p>

        <p>The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them respect for their assistance in
            escaping
            the tyranny of slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted slaves into their society when they made
            a break
            for freedom. They have never forgotten this support.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was a day often used to settle
            scores. The
            police were often unable to intervene due to the general confusion surrounding Mardi Gras events in the
            city, when
            the streets were crowded and everyone was masked. This kept many families away from the
            &quot;parade,&quot; and
            created much worry and concern for a mothers whose children wanted to join the Indians.</p>


        <p><em>&quot;&#39;I&#39;m gonna mask that morning if it costs me my life!&#39; That morning you pray and ask
                God to
                watch over you, cause everybody is bucking for number one.&quot;</em> - <strong>Larry
                Bannock</strong></p>

        <p>Today when two Mardi Gras Indian tribes pass one another, you will see a living theater of art and
            culture. Each
            tribe&#39;s style and dress is on display in a friendly but competitive manner. They compare one
            another&#39;s art
            and craftsmanship.</p>

        <p>The Big Chiefs of two different tribes start with a song/chant, ceremonial dance, and threatening
            challenge to
            &quot;Humba&quot;. The Big Chief&#39;s demand that the other Chief bows and pays respect. The retort is
            a whoop
            and equally impressive song and war dance with the reply, &quot;Me no Humba, YOU Humba!&quot;</p>

        <p><em>&quot;You know when you&#39;ve won, you see it in their eyes.&quot;</em> - <strong>Larry
                Bannock</strong></p>

        <p>Although there was a history of violence, many now choose to keep this celebration friendly. Each Big
            Chief will
            eventually stand back and, with a theatrical display of self-confidence, acknowledge the artistry and
            craftsmanship of the other chief&#39;s suit.</p>

        <p>Before the progression can continue, the two Big Chiefs will often comment privately to one another,
            &quot;Looking
            good, baby, looking good!&quot;</p>

        <p><em>&quot;After Mardi Gras, you thank GOD that you made it.&quot;</em> - <strong>Larry Bannock</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The good news is Mardi Gras day is no longer a day to &quot;settle scores&quot; among the Mardi Gras
            Indians. Now
            that the tradition and practice for the Indians to compare their tribal song, dance and dress with other
            tribes as
            they meet that day, violence is a thing of the past. The Mardi Gras Indian has invested thousands of
            hours and
            dollars in the creation of his suit, and will not run the risk of ruining it in a fight. This tradition,
            rich with
            folk art and history, is now appreciated by museums and historical societies around the world. It is a
            remarkable
            and welcome change from the past.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We hope you enjoyed reading about the Mardi Gras Indians as much as we have enjoyed bringing you the
            information
            about them. We thank the Mardi Gras Indian Council for opening their history books, and sharing their
            history and
            traditions with us.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #2a8530; text-align: center;" href="#info">Which
            krewes have the best throws</h1><br>
        <p>So what are &quot;throws?&quot; Well, they are exactly what they sound like - items that krewe members on
            floats throw to parade-goers as the floats pass by! Throws often include doubloons, beads, cups,
            homemade
            trinkets, toys and more!&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="350" src="images/img.webp" width="50%" /></p>

        <p>The throwing of trinkets to the crowds was started in the early 1870s by the Twelfth Night Revelers, and
            is a
            time-honored expectation for young and old alike.</p>

        <p>In 1884, Rex started using
            medallions
            instead of trinkets. These medallions are represented by today&#39;s doubloons, aluminum and anodized in
            many
            different colors. They depict the parade theme on one side and the Krewe&#39;s emblem on the other. They
            have
            become collectors items.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="350" src="images/img1.webp" width="50%" /></p>

        <p>In the Bacchus parade, the
            King&#39;s float throws doubloons with the image of the celebrity king on one side of the doubloon. If
            you&#39;re lucky enough to catch one, hold onto it!</p>

        <p>The most prized throws are the krewe&#39;s &quot;signature throws.&quot;Zulu has it famous coconuts and
            many
            other krewes offer hand-decorated items including Muses shoes, Nyx purses, Alla genie lamps, Carrollton
            shrimp boots and the list goes on. Most krewes have medallion beads that feature that year&#39;s theme.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="350" src="images/img2.webp" width="50%" /></p>

        <p>Other popular throws include cups (otherwise known as New Orleans dinnerware), long pearl beads and
            stuffed
            animals. Some throws even light up.</p>

        <p><strong>Be warned!</strong> If you&#39;re at your first parade and reach down to pick up a doubloon with
            your
            hand, your fingers may never be the same! Many stomp on doubloons in their rush to claim them.</p>

        <p>Hint: If you&#39;re standing next to a bunch of old grandmothers dressed in high heels and playboy bunny
            outfits, don&#39;t think your chances are any better. They may be old, but they have fast feet and the
            spikes
            on those heels - ouch!</p>
