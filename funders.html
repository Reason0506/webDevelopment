            <h1>Museum of Death</h1>
            <img src="images/death2.png" alt="" width="350" height="250" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:
                auto ;" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-560930">
            <p>
                Museum of Death is a museum with locations on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and
                New
                Orleans. It was
                established in June 1995 by J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz with the museum's stated goal being
                "to
                make people happy
                to be alive."

                The museum was originally established in 1995 in San Diego, in a building the owners claimed was
                the
                city's first
                mortuary. It began as a hobby of the founders J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz. They would write
                to
                serial killers they
                were interested in, and then show off the artwork their pen pals had created once a year at a
                specialist show. In 1995,
                after a few years of exhibitions, the collection, and many other materials, were made into a
                museum.
                <br><br>
                In late 1999, the couple attempted to acquire a large amount of materials from the Heaven's Gate
                cult suicides. Although
                they had been able to purchase many items prior to the main police auction, their interest in
                buying
                enough merchandise
                to recreate the scene in its entirety, led to enormous press interest and publicity. They were
                subsequently evicted by
                their landlord, and moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
                <br><br>
                Prior to the new Los Angeles building becoming a museum, the building was the home of Westbeach
                Recorders, and prior to
                that, Producers Studio, where Pink Floyd and others recorded. The walls include deadening agents
                to
                help with
                recordings, which now serve to lend a quiet acoustic setting for the various exhibitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2> New Orleans branch</h2>

                As of 2014, the couple had opened up a new branch of the museum in New Orleans called "Musée de
                Mort
                Orleans."
                The new museum branch will have around 12,000 square metres of space, which will allow more of
                the
                collection to be
                displayed. The limited space at the California museum means that only a third of the items
                available
                can be shown at
                one time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Collection</h2>
                <img src="images/death1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:
                auto ;" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-560930">
                The museum displays a wide variety of art and artifacts surrounding the subject of death. Baby
                coffins are in one
                section, letters and artwork from various serial killers in another. There are films regarding
                autopsies as well as
                explicit photographs of crime victims. There is also a room filled exclusively with taxidermy of
                various types of
                animals. The museum's recreation of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide includes the original beds.
                However, the most
                notable item at the museum is the head of Henri Landru. In 2014 the museum also acquired
                Thanatron,
                one of the
                original suicide machines built by Jack Kevorkian.
                <br><br>
                Once a year, the museum holds a Black Dahlia look-alike competition, where contestants have to
                dress
                as both pre-
                and post-mortem Dahlia.
                <br><br>
                A 2001 attempt to procure a real electric chair was unsuccessful.
